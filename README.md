# sorted_vector_map

`sorted_vector_map` is an implementation of an ordered map and set (like
`std::collections::BTreeMap` and `std::collections::BTreeSet`) using a sorted
vector as the backing store.

Sorted vector maps are appropriate when data is frequently loaded from an
ordered source, queried a small number of times, and infrequently modified
through insertion or removal.

Loading from an ordered sequence is _O(n)_ through an optimization to `insert`
that handles in-order insertions specially. Extension of the sequence is also
optimized, where extending a map or set of size n with m elements in a single
operation is _O(n + m log m)_. Otherwise, loading from an unordered sequence is
_O(n^2)_.

Look-up is _O(log n)_ through binary search. Insertion and removal are both
_O(n)_, as are set operations like intersection, union and difference.

`sorted_vector_map` is part of
[rust-shed](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/rust-shed). See the
rust-shed repository for more documentation, including the contributing guide.

This is a copy of the original `sorted_vector_map` crate, but with some
modifications to make it work with an other project [ngram-trie](https://github.com/behappiness/ngram-trie).
It is serializable and deserializable, also some other capacity related methods are added.
